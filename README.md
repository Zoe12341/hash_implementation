Implements a hash table in python as an array of linked lists. Built to compare the speeds of different the different hash functions, and saves the speeds to a csv file. Five different hash functions are given as options to use (including the default python one). This allows users to compare how well various hash functions perform. 

The initial number of table entries and the size of the array can be edited. The values added to the table come from people_data.csv.
